# RidePal

Ridepal is an app that uses the Strava API to track wear on components on your bike. Overly worn components can put you at risk for potentially deadly incidents if not checked and replaced properly. Rather than wondering how long you put those tires on ago, and assuming they are fine, now you can track exactly how many miles are on a certain component, as well as keep logs of how long components last you in order to compare with manufacturer specs.

An active strava account is required to use RidePal. It is recommended that for maximum accuracy, you record every ride that you do on the bike.

RidePal is built using React, Redux, Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

Any comments, bugs, or feature recommendations can be directed to me, Spencer Collins, at spencermcollins@gmail.com.

Ride Safe, Ride with a Pal!
